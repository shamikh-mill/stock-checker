# stock-checker
Simple stock portfolio analytics using pandas  

This is a Jupyter Notebook I made to provide simple price differential insights and visualizations on my current stock portfolio on the RobinHood mobile application. It uses the Yahoo Finance module in python to pull current stock price data.  

To perform your own analysis of your portfolio, input your stock ticker values, the price at which you bought your shares, and the quantity of shares you bought onto the excel document table. Then, open and run the stock-checker.ipynb file, and it will pull current prices of stocks and import the data from your excel document.
